/**
 * Exercise 46 - Word Frequency Finder
 * Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful for creating word clouds and other types of word analysis.
 * And itâ€™s more useful when running it against lots of text.
 *
 * Create a program that reads in a file named `exercise46_input.txt` and counts the frequency of words in the file.
 * Then construct a histogram displaying the words and the frequency, and display the histogram to the screen.
 *
 * Example Output
 *
 * Given the text file `exercise46_input.txt` with this content
 *----------------------------------------------------------------
 * badger badger badger
 * badger mushroom
 * mushroom snake badger badger
 * badger
 *----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * the program would produce the following output:
 *----------------------------------------------------------------
 * badger:   *******
 * mushroom: **
 * snake:    *
 *----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Constraint
 *
 * Ensure that the most used word is at the top of the report and the least used words are at the bottom.
 *
 * Challenges
 *
 * Use a graphical program and generate bar graphs.
 * Test the performance of your calculation by providing a very large input file, such as Shakespeare's Macbeth.
 * Tweak your algorithm so that it performs the word counting as fast as possible.
 * Write the program in another language and compare the processing times of the two implementations.
